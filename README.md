# Haskell

Well, seeing as there is no Plutus testnet yet, a node wouldn't make sense at this point. Once there is a node supporting Plutus, I'll let you know, and we should install it.
You should have a Haskell environment running GHC 8.10.2.
Also, it would be great if you could clone the Plutus repository at https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus and try to get a nix-shell running.
